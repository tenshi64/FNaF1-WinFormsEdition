# FNaF1-WinFormsEdition
This project was created for educational purposes only.
FNaF1-Reimagined is a prototype that recreates some of the core mechanics of Five Nights at Freddy’s in a Windows Forms application using C# and .NET.
It was made as a personal learning project to experiment with UI-driven game logic and event handling outside a traditional game engine.

## Overview
This prototype demonstrates how core gameplay elements can be recreated using standard **Windows Forms** architecture.
It is not a full game, but a simplified recreation of certain systems and interactions from the original title.

Implemented features:

  - Door and light control system
  - UI mimicking the original layout
  - Basic input and event handling

### Please note:<br />
Minor visual glitches may occur during movement, as Windows Forms is an older technology not optimized for rendering moving elements such as PictureBox controls.
These visual artifacts are expected and a limitation of the framework, not the logic itself.

## Technical Details
  - Built with C# and Windows Forms (.NET Framework)
  - Focused on replicating basic gameplay logic and UI flow
  - Designed as a learning exercise in desktop application programming, not a playable remake
